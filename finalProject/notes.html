    <main>
        <p>For the 2D physics used in my applications, I used <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/">Matter.js.</a> Besides learning the basics of the library, 
        I had to understand the particular ways that declarations must be organized in object instantiation in order to add properties 
        to the objects in the area. For example, the walls of the rooms had to have a 
        isStatic rule (to keep them from falling out of the viewspace) before the call 
        for render (which can be used to determine color). Similarly, the order in which 
        the object's base properties (such as width/height, and location) are very 
        particular.</p>
        <p>As well as basic object instantiation in Matter.js, I had to learn the composites 
            system (Matter.Composites) in order to create the pyramid shape at the beginning 
            of the Box Room. Understanding how objects interact and what can happen when 
            too many objects inhabit the screen where lessons I had to take in and use 
            well to create the calm experience that I set out to do with the site. 
            It was actually more difficult to rein in this urge to fill the page with 
            all the physics-enabled objects I could once I learned how to accurately 
            place them in good places in the room. I'm pleased that I limited this desire,
            as it is a far more fulfilling experience for the rooms to have the current number 
            of objects that populate the page's rooms.</p>
        <p>Sadly, I was not able to reach a level of complexity that I wanted to. In an 
            earlier plan for my page, I wanted to include a room that had numerous 
            ball-shaped objects that fell like a coursing river; this was dubbed River Room 
            in an earlier plan. However, the wrap function in Matter.js is poorly documented 
            and I had to change plans. This is where I devised the Slider room, which is 
            based on the game Shuffleboard and features three boxes with low friction.</p>
        <p>I was inspired by the <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#friction">Friction demo</a> for the Slider room, the 
            <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#restitution">Restitution demo</a> for the Ball Room, and the <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#pyramid">Pyramid demo</a> 
            for the Box Room. However, I wanted to differ from these demos by having my own 
            unified coloring scheme, and masking some of the technical aspects of these demos 
            (such as the velocity and angle markers) for the sake of the calm aesthetic I was 
            pushing for. I also took to changing parameters, such as changing the scale of objects 
            to make them a good size for throwing and catching with the mouse. </p>
        <p>Of things I had to improve upon in terms of skills unrelated to Matter.js, I had 
            to come to a better understanding on CSS commands and HTML organization to get the 
            most out of my pages without being extremely cluttered or looking unprofessional. 
            I recognized that improvement on my older skills was a necessity, and the results 
            of this analysis are clear to me. Along with a more coherent color scheme, the page 
            gained from my extension into CSS when I learned how to make lists appear horizontal 
            and fit more cleanly in-line with the rest of the content. </p>
