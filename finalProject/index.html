        <p>Welcome to Relaxing Physics! The goal of this site is to provide small applications with 2D physics that allow for free exploration and enjoyment. Each 'room' has a description of their contents on their page, and it's encouraged that one takes their time and simply does as they please in the room. If a room's contents are somehow thrown outside its walls, please refresh the page to return it to its original state!</p>
        <p>For every room, there will be links to the other rooms, and back to this page. The author passes along sincere hopes that you enjoy your time here!</p>
