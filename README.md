Project 4 for IGME-230

My project will be a small series of mini-apps which are meant to be mindless; small tech demos which are amusing to simply play with. The goal is to create three small things, described below, which are simply open places for the user to play with the given tools. 
The first will be a simple ball, rendered within a box on-screen that has physics active on it, with gravity acting on it. The user should be able to click and take hold of the ball, and be able to throw it around the space. It will bounce, though it can come to a stop due to forces being degraded over time. 
The second will be a drawing app, not unlike the exercise we did in-class. However, along with a larger array of colors available, it will also include a larger space to draw and small grid-size so the pictures can be higher resolution. 
The third mini-app will be an effect demo, where the mouse creates a ripple effect when dragged across a black box (this is inspired by the D3 demo, OMG Particles II), with modification which will allow the user to change the shape of the effect. 
Each of these will be divided into their own pages, each connected to a landing page. Each page will then be connected to each other, but not back to the original landing page; the landing page will have served its purpose by that point. 

Here's a basic layout of the HTML structure: 
Connected by a header menu
Ball<-->Drawing<-->Effects
^        ^           ^
|        |           |
\--------|-----------/                        
   Landing Page

Each page will be relatively simple, using plain and non-obtrusive colors to maintain focus on the center of the page. This is so the user focuses on the applications, and has a calmer experience. 
In order to complete these objectives, I will have to learn how to program physics in Javascript, and how to apply those physics to a locked space in a browser. I will also have to learn the d3 systems deeply, as well as how to use Javascript efficiently to make the most of those systems. I will have to understand, as well, how the different versions of d3 affect the way I create the things I need.
