Project 4 for IGME-230

My goal for this project is to create a site with a small series of physics-based mini-games, designed to be played idly with the mouse. These 'games' will, in essence, be small environments with small objects the user can interact with easily. There is no winning/losing, as the open spaces are meant to give the user the ability to choose what they do within the environment given to them. These pages will be listed on a main page, and listed on the other pages in a drop-down menu in alphabetical order. 
The first and foremost important page I will complete will be the Ball Room, which will consist of a box area with a ball inside of it. It will be capable of bouncing against the bounds of the environment, and will bounce until it comes to a stop. The goal is to give the user a simple space where they can simply enjoy toying with the physics. For example, the user may toss the ball up and try to catch it, or they may wish to toss it around aimlessly. The point is to give the user freedom to explore the physics presented to them. The user will also have the ability to change the color of the ball via a small menu below the play area. 
As I have more time to devise more games from here, such as a building blocks area or an avalanche simulator to name a few, I will add to a list on this page to fully list the areas and functions of the site. The goal is to increase scope as time passes, so I do not give myself unattainable goals; the primary objective is to set challenges based on what is learned. 
The page format will go as follows:

Landing Page with Menu-----------Chosen Area Page

The Current list of environments/games will be here: 
Slider Ball Box


In order to build new things using Matter.js, I will have to become aware of how the systems work, and how outside elements in the page can affect the created physics areas on the page. Along with basic and advanced functions used by the script, I will have to also learn how to elegantly design the page so it is easy to navigate, calm on the eyes, and interesting to the user. 

Below is the link to my repository; it is public.
